# BCG-Data-Sciance-and-Analytics
BCG Data Science and Analytics Virtual Internship

Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
---------------------------------------------------
Your first task today is to understand what is going on with the client and to think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the client and the analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
---------------------------------
Sub-Task 1:
Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset. You should spend around 1 hour on this.

Sub-Task 2:
Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it. You should spend around 30 minutes on this.


Sub-Task 3:
Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation â€“ which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open source datasets might be useful? You should spend 10-15 minutes on this.

For your final deliverable, please submit your analysis (in the form of a jupyter notebook, code script or PDF) as well as your half-page summary document.

Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modeling

Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
